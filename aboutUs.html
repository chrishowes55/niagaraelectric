      <p class="text-bigger">Head of Web Design and All-Around Correcter, Chris has spent a lot of time working closely with other members of the team to
        bring you seamless web integration from this project, but, as if that wasn't enough, he has also strived to correct all incorrect grammar
        throughout this project, although sadly most of the leaflet was already printed before he got to look at it, so don't read that too closely.
        All in all, you can have a look at the resto, but we all know he's the besto.</p>

          <h1 class="title-small">Ngoni Huruva</h1>
          <p class="text-bigger">Our Head of Marketing, Ngoni has worked closely with Josh (Head of Design) to create our leaflet, putting in hours to get
            our content in there and arranged beautifully.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="box right col-xs-6">
          <h1 class="title-small">Josh Wright</h1>
          <p class="text-bigger">Our Head of Design, Josh has put his art skills (thank God we had an artist!) to work in order to help Ngoni create a
            beautiful leaflet which helps get the point of our organisation across.</p>

          <h1 class="title-small">Kate Murphy</h1>
          <p class="text-bigger">As Head of Research, Kate did a great job of gathering enough information to support both our leaflet and website, she
            has also helped with design on both fronts. Not only this, she is also the lead part of our debating line-up, and will hopefully help
            us to defeat the opposition in our upcoming debate.</p>

      <div class="box right col-xs-6">
          <h1 class="title-small">Ozan Nicholls</h1>
          <p class="text-bigger">Our Head of Procrastination, Ozan has managed to do very little! In fact, I'd go as far as to say that you could set him
            a challenge and he'd be able to complete it in at least three times as long as it should take; it's just a talent of his. He did, in fact, get
            a fair amount of research done and that, in itself, was a very useful contribution to this project.</p>
