      <h1 class="title-small">About Hydroelectricity</h1>
      <p class="text-bigger">Hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform a multitude of other tasks. Hydropower is completely renewable,
        as it doesn't actually use up the water required for the power, unlike nuclear and fossil fuels. The costs of hydroelectricity are relatively low when
        compared to other sources of energy, and we provide our power at similar, if not lower, costs to other providers. Hydropower is also very flexible, as
        the amount of energy being produced can be increased or decreased easily based on demand.&nbsp;Our power is created in a hydroelectric power plant. We
        build tidal barrages, and inside these water is forced through gaps, transforming the gravitational potential energy that the water had before it went
        down the tube into kinetic energy, and then the magic happens. Our electricity generators are driven by the water rushing throught the tubes, and then
        the power is transferred straight to you.</p>

  		    <h1 class="title-small">Advantages of Hydroelectricity</h1>
          <ul class="text">
            <li>The energy generated from hydropower relies on the water cycle, which is driven by the sun</li>
            <li>This means that hydropower is more reliable, affordable and, most importantly, 'green' than competing sources of power</li>
            <li>Hydropower is also something that can be fitted anywhere with a water supply</li>
            <li>Facilities that use our hydroelectricity can go from having no power to having maximum power in seconds, helping massively during power outages</li>
            <li>Of course, the biggest benefit of hydroelectricity is the fact that it is a clean energy source, meaning that it will not pollute the air,
              and it isn't going to be detrimental to future generations. They will thank you for supporting us!</li>

          <h1 class="title-small">Disadvantages of Other Forms of Energy</h1>
          <ul class="text">
            <li>Fossil Fuels are an outdated energy source. There is an ever-decreasing number of fossil fuels left in the world, the use of them is not
              evironmentally-friendly and the use of them can be dangerous, leading to accidents like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill</li>
            <li>Nuclear Energy is a perfectly 'green' source of energy, but it, like fossil fuels, cannot last forever: we are running out of the fuels
              required. The accidents associated with nuclear power are also much more damaging than those of fossil fuels, leading to radioactivity in
              the area for thousands of years</li>
            <li>Wind Energy has none of the problems of the above sources of energy, but it can only be harvested as long as there is wind. No wind means
              no power, so the locations for wind farms must be chosen carefully</li>
